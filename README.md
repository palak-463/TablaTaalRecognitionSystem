# 🥁 Tabla Taal Recognition System

The **Tabla Taal Recognition System** is an advanced research project focusing on the recognition and classification of Classical Indian Music **Tabla Taals**. The system identifies renowned Taals like **Addhatrital, Ektal, Rupak, Dadra, Deepchandi, Jhaptal, Trital,** and **Bhajani**. By using machine learning models, including **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN)** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**, the system effectively analyzes and categorizes complex rhythmic patterns in Indian Classical Music.

## 🎯 System Overview

This system uses a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** where users can upload audio files containing Tabla performances. Once uploaded, the system processes the audio, recognizes the Taal, and displays the classification result.

<br>

## 🔑 Working

- **Taal Recognition**: Efficient recognition of various classical **Tabla Taals**.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses **FNN** and **CNN** for high-accuracy Taal classification.
- **GUI for Easy Interaction**: Provides a simple and user-friendly interface for uploading and analyzing audio files.
- **Dataset Training**: Trained on a large set of Classical Indian Music recordings for robust and accurate results.
